# Hangman

## Description:
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation:
Ensure that the `random` module is available for import into the hangman file.

## Playing The Game:
Run the `milestone_3.py` file and a prompt will appear. Enter a single letter as prompted.

## File Structure:
The file contains two functions, `check_guess()` and `ask_for_input()`. These functions checks that the letter guesses are in the secret word and that the user input is a valid single letter resectively.
